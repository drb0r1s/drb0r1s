<p align="center">
   Hello everyone, my name is Boris (drbr0r1s), I am a Front-end Web Developer. I have been studying Web Development for more than 2 years and I can say that I have a      lot of experience in this field. For now, my experience is based on individual projects. Each of my projects is published on Github along with the source code and        documentation, which tells more about the project.
